# Balthazar's Protfolio

My portfolio website is currently under development. It will be a static website showcasing some featured projects in a simple homepage quickly taking the user through a cool animated web experience. Later on I'll probably also add a blog to publish some tech related stuff.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ bun install
```

Lauch the development server:

```bash
$ bun run dev
```
